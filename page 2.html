After all, the heading to your text holds a lot of power. If it’s magnetic, people will read the body. If it doesn’t hook them, they’ll leave. In the words of David Ogilvy, “On the average, five times as many people read the headlines than the body copy.” This makes writing headlines the most exhilarating and pressurizing part of copywriting simultaneously. Explains why some people think it’s best to write their headline copy at the end and stick to formulas while creating one as well. In this post, let’s dive into writing engaging headlines. To give you a quick look, this piece will cover:

        <h1  style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">What is a Headline Copy?</h1>
        <h3  style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Your headline copy is the title you give to your written content.

            This can be the heading of a webpage, an article, or any piece of copywriting. Your headline is the first thing a reader sees not only because it’s the first line, at the top of the page, but also because it’s often in a bigger, bold font.
            
            Typically, people confuse a headline for a header. But there’s a fundamental difference between the two.
            
            A header, unlike a headline, comes multiple times inside a text. It divides a copy into sections and is a title to a particular section, not the entire piece as a headline is.

            <h1  style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">How Do You Write a Headline for a Website?</h1>

        <h3  style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">It’s easy to write a headline for a website. What’s difficult is writing a headline that makes the reader stop, stay, and scroll down.

            If your headline copy doesn’t manage to do this, you’ll lose money. You can say that the few words that go into the website’s title can make or break sales for you.
            
            So, how do you write an effective headline for a website?  <br>
            
           
            <br>
            Here’s how:</h3> 
            <h4>
<ol>


    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Keep it succinct. Your headline should be between 6 to 12 words. It would be best if you kept it on the shorter side of 6 or fewer words.</li>
    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Write for your target audience. Study your target audience to write a headline that hooks them immediately.</li>
    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Take your time. You don’t have to write the headline first, and you don’t have to write just one headline. You can write the headline at the end and create a few ones to choose from.</li>
    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Be specific. Your headline should be clear about how the reader will benefit. For this reason, it needs to be fluff-free and simple, along with unique.</li>
    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Test repeatedly. Testing what’s working and what’s not helps write better headlines. Test which type of headline decreases bounce rate and increases click-thru rate.</li>
</ol>

    <new=li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Asana</li>
</h2> <img src="qf.PNG" alt="Asana">
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Amanda Slegar of Lone Fir Creative describes Asana’s homepage headline as “perfect.” Slegar explains what makes the headline so on point: “It is written for a leader in an organization that is working in their business and not on it. But who wants to shift their focus to ideas and away from implementation. Oftentimes brands get caught up in using the priceless headline real estate to advertise a new product or discount, but in reality, it should used to tell your user what you will help them do.”</h3>

        <h2>
    <new=li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">QickMail</li>
</h2> <img src="sf.PNG" alt="QickMail">
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Another copy headline that you can learn from is that of Quickmail’s homepage. “I like the QuickMail home page. The initial headline clearly tells you WHAT you get with the platform – better email automation. Once the headline pulls you in, there are great testimonial quotes from customers,” notes Bruce Harpham of SaaS Marketing Services.</h3>


    <h2>
        <new=li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Crazy Egg</li>
    </h2> <img src="asv.PNG" alt="Crazy Egg">
    <h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">“Crazy Egg has one of the best homepage headlines I’ve seen. Theirs is ‘Make Your Website Better. Instantly,’” points out Nikola Roza of SEO for the Poor and Determined. “They’ve had this headline for years, and I’m sure they keep it because it works.”Roza highlights what exactly makes Crazy Egg’s headline copy work: “First, it tells the reader they can improve their site, which is something every webmaster wants. Second, with ‘Instantly’, they promise a quick, if not instantaneous solution. Third, their headline is reinforced with some social proof below where they say ‘over 300 000 websites use CrazyEgg to see what’s working, fix what isn’t, and test new ideas.’ And they offer a free 30-day trial right underneath that social proof. Very clever!”</h3>

    </h2> <img src="morphe.PNG" alt="Morphe">
    <h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"> Jason Wong of Doelashes shares Morphe’s headline as an example.

    Wong says, “Morphe is always killing it with their headlines. They are an authoritative site on makeup, and they know it. Morphe was made popular by the constant announcements of social media influencers. Morphe then leverages this platform and uses influencers as their headlines with new makeup. People watch and follow trends that influencers have so, why not put the most popular influencer as your headline and grab all of the influencer’s audience to sell products.”That’s one unique way to write headlines, isn’t it? Wong further elaborates, “The reason this works is that trends fade very fast, so, by updating and putting the most influential influencer on your homepage, you will always stay in a competitive zone among your industry.”Jason Wong of Doelashes shares Morphe’s headline as an example.

    </h2> <img src="Ding.PNG" alt="Ding">
    <h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">
        Luke Fitzgerald of Ding points in the directions of Ding’s homepage headline that reads, ’We deliver mobile top-up to millions worldwide.’ Fitzgerald talks about the reason behind why the website’s headline stands out, saying, “it’s concise, easy to understand and does exactly what it says on the tin!”</h3>

    <h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Another copy headline example that speaks to its customers is that of Weight Watchers. Jack Paxton of HYAX says that it “has a headline that is very much to the point. People that visit this website are looking to better themselves. WW’s direct approach is exactly what their target audience needs to take action.”The headline is ‘Free to join, free month, plus a free kickstart kit.’ Paxton opines that “this offer makes use of the ‘power of free,’ a strategy that is meant to grab a person’s attention. This headline immediately offers visitors value in the form of free membership for a month and a kickstarter kit.”</h3>
